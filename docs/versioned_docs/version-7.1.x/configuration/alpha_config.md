:::warning
This page contains documentation for alpha features.
We reserve the right to make breaking changes to the features detailed within this page with no notice.

Options described in this page may be changed, removed, renamed or moved without prior warning.
Please beware of this before you use alpha configuration options.
:::

This page details a set of **alpha** configuration options in a new format.
Going forward we are intending to add structured configuration in YAML format to
replace the existing TOML based configuration file and flags.

Below is a reference for the structure of the configuration, with
[AlphaOptions](#alphaoptions) as the root of the configuration.

When using alpha configuration, your config file will look something like below:

```yaml
upstreams:
  - id: ...
    ...
injectRequestHeaders:
  - name: ...
    ...
injectResponseHeaders:
  - name: ...
    ...
```

Please browse the [reference](#configuration-reference) below for the structure
of the new configuration format.

## Using Alpha Configuration

To use the new **alpha** configuration, generate a YAML file based on the format
described in the [reference](#configuration-reference) below.

Provide the path to this file using the `--alpha-config` flag.

:::note
When using the `--alpha-config` flag, some options are no longer available.
See [removed options](#removed-options) below for more information.
:::

### Converting configuration to the new structure

Before adding the new `--alpha-config` option, start OAuth2 Proxy using the
`convert-config-to-alpha` flag to convert existing configuration to the new format.

```bash
oauth2-proxy --convert-config-to-alpha --config ./path/to/existing/config.cfg
```

This will convert any options supported by the new format to YAML and print the
new configuration to `STDOUT`.

Copy this to a new file, remove any options from your existing configuration
noted in [removed options](#removed-options) and then start OAuth2 Proxy using
the new config.

```bash
oauth2-proxy --alpha-config ./path/to/new/config.yaml --config ./path/to/existing/config.cfg
```

## Removed options

The following flags/options and their respective environment variables are no
longer available when using alpha configuration:

<!-- Legacy Upstream FlagSet -->
- `flush-interval`/`flush_interval`
- `pass-host-header`/`pass_host_header`
- `proxy-websockets`/`proxy_websockets`
- `ssl-upstream-insecure-skip-verify`/`ssl_upstream_insecure_skip_verify`
- `upstream`/`upstreams`

<!-- Legacy Headers FlagSet -->
- `pass-basic-auth`/`pass_basic_auth`
- `pass-access-token`/`pass_access_token`
- `pass-user-headers`/`pass_user_headers`
- `pass-authorization-header`/`pass_authorization_header`
- `set-basic-auth`/`set_basic_auth`
- `set-xauthrequest`/`set_xauthrequest`
- `set-authorization-header`/`set_authorization_header`
- `prefer-email-to-user`/`prefer_email_to_user`
- `basic-auth-password`/`basic_auth_password`
- `skip-auth-strip-headers`/`skip_auth_strip_headers`

Attempting to use these options via flags or via config when `--alpha-config`
set will result in an error.

:::important
You must remove these options before starting OAuth2 Proxy with `--alpha-config`

### AlphaOptions

AlphaOptions contains alpha structured configuration options.
Usage of these options allows users to access alpha features that are not
available as part of the primary configuration structure for OAuth2 Proxy.

:::warning
The options within this structure are considered alpha.
They may change between releases without notice.
:::

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

| `injectRequestHeaders` | _[[]Header](#header)_ | InjectRequestHeaders is used to configure headers that should be added<br/>to requests to upstream servers.<br/>Headers may source values from either the authenticated user's session<br/>or from a static secret value. |
| `injectResponseHeaders` | _[[]Header](#header)_ | InjectResponseHeaders is used to configure headers that should be added<br/>to responses from the proxy.<br/>This is typically used when using the proxy as an external authentication<br/>provider in conjunction with another proxy such as NGINX and its<br/>auth_request module.<br/>Headers may source values from either the authenticated user's session<br/>or from a static secret value. |
| `server` | _[Server](#server)_ | Server is used to configure the HTTP(S) server for the proxy application.<br/>You may choose to run both HTTP and HTTPS servers simultaneously.<br/>This can be done by setting the BindAddress and the SecureBindAddress simultaneously.<br/>To use the secure server you must configure a TLS certificate and key. |
| `metricsServer` | _[Server](#server)_ | MetricsServer is used to configure the HTTP(S) server for metrics.<br/>You may choose to run both HTTP and HTTPS servers simultaneously.<br/>This can be done by setting the BindAddress and the SecureBindAddress simultaneously.<br/>To use the secure server you must configure a TLS certificate and key. |

ClaimSource allows loading a header value from a claim within the session

A duration string is a is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers,
